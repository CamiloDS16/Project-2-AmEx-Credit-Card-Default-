## Overview
The American Express Credit Line Default Classifier is a project aimed at predicting the probability of a customer defaulting on their credit line. Defaulting in this context means not paying back their balance for 120 days. This model will provide a tool for credit card companies like American Express to better manage their risk and enhance their decision-making processes.

## Motivation
Credit card default is a substantial challenge in the financing industry. With an ever-growing number of individuals and businesses utilizing credit cards due to their convenience and robust rewards system, credit card issuers face a higher risk of customers not paying back their balance. This project seeks to address this problem by using data science to provide insights that can drive decision-making.
